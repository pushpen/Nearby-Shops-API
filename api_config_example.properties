# JDBC connection URL for connecting to Postgres DB. TaxiReferralDB is the name of Database for our service
# jdbc:postgresql://host:port/database is the format for the JDBC url. Because the database and api is on the same

# can now provide the name of the new database here

# For maps we use TileServerGL open source project which serves vector maps using OSM data. 
# Its available at tileserver.org
# Create a tileserverGL Instance which you can do on 
# a 10 $ per month server on DO (Digital Ocean) and place your style url here.
# you also need to buy a map for your city from open map tiles website.
# If you dont know what does styleURL mean then search for it on google
# You can get your map up and running in just 10 $ per month plus map cost of 15$ using this project. 
# which is much lower compared to spending 10000 $ annual for a commertial licence in case of google maps
# On the client side we render maps using mapbox android GL SDK without using any mapbox api key
